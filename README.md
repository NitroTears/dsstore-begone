DS_Store Begone
========================

This is a simple program I wrote that can remove all .DS_Store files from a selected drive.

The exact files and folders removed from the drive are:
-   The ``.fseventsd`` folder.
-   The ``.Trashes`` folder.
-   The ``.Spotlight-V100`` folder.
-   Files beginning with ``._``. For example, ``._MUSICASSIGNMENT.docx``
-   Files named ``.DS_Store``.

This is my first personal programming repo, and I'm happy with the way it turned out.
